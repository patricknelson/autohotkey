## Double Context Fix.ahk ##

In Windows 8.x and Windows 10 file explorer (Windows Explorer), when you right-click the title bar and select an option (e.g. "Minimize") it will erroneously re-display the context menu for the window again AFTER you've selected the option, leaving the menu hanging there until you click something else to close it. This is a fix.
